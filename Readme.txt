In response to the December 2011 White House - Startup America Policy Challenge, sixteen partner institutions designed and executed The Policy Challenge, a national administrative policy proposal competition. 

Running from January 30 to May 21, 2012, the Policy Challenge asked public administration students, faculty, practitioners and the general public to build on the results of the Startup America Policy Challenge to propose innovative, viable, and actionable plans for administrative change in education, clean energy, and healthcare. 

Continuing participation was scaffolded across two proposal stages of competition, culminating in a finale event. 

A short-form proposal stage ran from January 30 to April 2 and was “open to the American public”. Individuals and small teams were invited to submit a two-page short-form proposal, addressing the challenge of using new technologies in the administration of education, clean energy, and healthcare. A judging panel selected three finalist teams in each of the three issue areas, with those teams invited to participate in the next stage.

In the long-form proposal stage, running from April 17 to May 11, each of the nine finalist teams were asked to develop a 15-page long-form proposal that elaborated on their initial idea in consultation with content experts.

The competition culminated in The Policy Challenge Finale on May 21 2012, where the finalist teams presented their proposals to high-level representatives of the federal agencies and a panel of expert judges. The winning team in each issue area were announced at the finale and their proposals were shared with the Cabinet Secretary from the relevant federal agency. A subsequent NSF-funded workshop reflecting on “Participatory Challenge Platforms with a Public Intent” was held the next day. Full reports on The Policy Challenge and the Workshop are available online.
